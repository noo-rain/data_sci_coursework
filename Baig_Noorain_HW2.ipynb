Remember that there is a [reference guide](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) linked on Canvas on writing math in Markdown. **All** of your written commentary, justifications and mathematical work should be in Markdown.\n",

    "According to the figure, the highest age range of survivors was between 20 and 30. The bars are of similar lengths for age ranges 40 to 70, and there seems to be a higher amount of children between ages 0-15 dying than surviving. The survival rates for ages 40, 40, 55, and 60 are slightly higher than the death rates, but the only columns with a distinct higher survival rate are ages 15-20, 20-25, 25-30, with 20-25 having the highest survival rate. This might be explained by the fact that younger, healthier people would be able to make it to the deck faster, and would probably beat other passengers to the lifeboats. \n"

Whether or not you found evidence for these cases in the data, you might find it interesting to watch the movie (or just the segments of the sinking) to see one interpretation of these ideas. You can perhaps see how we might be persuaded to reinterpret the evidence of data by a heart-wrenching performance from a handsome young Leonardo DiCaprio!"
